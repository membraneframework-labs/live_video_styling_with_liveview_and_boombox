# Echo Demo

Gets the WebRTC video stream from the browser and sends it back.

Uses Boombox and Phoenix Live.

The most imporant part of this demo is `echo_demo/lib/demo_web/live/home_live.ex`.

JS file that creates necessary LiveView hooks is `echo_demo/assets/js/app.js`.

## Run

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
